# Mango harvesting date prediction model

## Introduction 
Choosing the wrong harvesting time has serious consequences on product quality and shelf-life. Ehe EU4AI sub-granted project 008 – FreshSatellites has developed an AI based decision support module for mango farmers and wholesalers to choose the optimum date for harvesting mangos.

The AI model assesses the local vegetational details of the growing area by analyzing satellite images and will return the optimum local harvesting date for a specific region under consideration.  

Please note: the module provide sufficiently accurate results in a time frame of roughly 4 months prior to harvest. You may query the module to predict next years harvesting, e.g. by providing October satellite images for next June/July harvest, but the results will be of low accuracy.  

## Disclaimer
Despite being built on good scientific practice, the module is meant for educational purposes only. Please contact us is you are interested in using our calibrated models for your specific use case.
